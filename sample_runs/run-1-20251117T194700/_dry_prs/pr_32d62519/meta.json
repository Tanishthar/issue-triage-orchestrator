  "title": "[Triage] proposed fix - Support for Multi-Agent Orchestration Where a Main Agent Rea",
  "body": "Automated triage: proposed fix sketch\\n\\nRoot cause: The current multi\u2011agent framework treats each agent as an isolated process with its own prompt and execution context. There is no shared state mechanism, so a background agent cannot persist its results for the main agent to consume. The main agent therefore never sees the data produced by the background agent, causing the orchestration scenario described in the issue to fail.\n\nProposed fix:\n1. Introduce a lightweight SharedStorage abstraction (e.g., a class that can read/write JSON, SQLite or Redis). The abstraction should expose `read()` and `write(key, value)` methods and be configurable via a URI so that different back\u2011ends can be swapped.\n2. Extend the base `Agent` class (or the concrete agent implementation used in the repo) to accept an optional `storage` argument. Provide helper methods `store(key, value)` and `load(key)` that delegate to the shared storage instance.\n3. Modify the agent execution loop so that, before each turn, the main agent calls `self.load_all()` (or a similar helper) to fetch any pending data from storage and inject it into the prompt context (e.g., via a templating variable like `{shared_data}`).\n4. Ensure the background agent writes its output to storage using `self.store('bg_result', result)` at the end of its turn.\n5. Add a small orchestration helper (e.g., `run_multi_agent(main_agent, bg_agent, storage)`) that runs the background agent first, then the main agent, handling the storage lifecycle (creating the storage object, cleaning it up after the run, etc.).\n6. Update documentation and examples to show how to configure the shared storage location (file path, DB URL, Redis URL) and how to reference stored values inside the main agent's prompt.\n\nWith these changes the main agent will be able to read the results produced by the background agent and incorporate them into its response, satisfying the multi\u2011agent orchestration requirement.\\n\\nRepro steps:\\n- Clone the repository containing the multi\u2011agent framework to your local machine.\\n- Install all required dependencies (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt` or the appropriate package manager).\\n- Set up a shared storage location that both agents can access (e.g., a JSON file, a SQLite database, or a Redis cache).\\n- Configure a **background agent** with a prompt that generates output and writes its result to the shared storage (ensure the agent\u2019s code includes a write operation to the chosen storage).\\n- Configure the **main agent** with a prompt that reads from the shared storage at the start of each turn and incorporates any new background\u2011agent data into its response.",
