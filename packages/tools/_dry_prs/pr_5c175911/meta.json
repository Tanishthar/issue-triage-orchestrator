  "body": "Automated triage: proposed fix sketch\\n\\nThe root cause hypothesis is that the README file contains invalid HTML structure. Upon reviewing the provided code snippet, it appears that the HTML document has multiple `<link>` tags with incorrect attributes. The fix approach would be to refactor the README file's HTML structure to adhere to standard practices and ensure all links are correctly attributed.\n\nSpecifically, we need to:\n\n* Remove duplicate or unnecessary link tags\n* Update link attributes (e.g., `data-color-theme`, `crossorigin`) to match expected standards\n* Consider adding a consistent class or ID to each link tag for easier styling\n\nWe can achieve this by modifying the README file's HTML template and ensuring it complies with GitHub's documentation guidelines.\n\nTo verify our fix, we'll need to create a test that simulates the original issue. However, since the actual issue is unclear without more context (i.e., the missing GitHub issue text), we'll focus on testing the modified README file's HTML structure instead.\\n\\nRepro steps:\\n- However, I don't see any GitHub issue provided for me to extract reproduction steps from. Please provide the issue text, and I'll do my best to extract the clear reproduction steps as a numbered list.\\n- Once you provide the issue text, I'll be happy to assist you!",
